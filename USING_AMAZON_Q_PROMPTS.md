# Using Amazon Q Developer Prompts for CompliAgent-SG

This guide explains how to use the Amazon Q Developer prompts to implement the CompliAgent-SG system.

## What are Amazon Q Developer Prompts?

Amazon Q Developer prompts are structured instructions that guide Amazon Q in generating code, configurations, and solutions for specific tasks. They provide context, requirements, and expectations to help Amazon Q deliver more accurate and relevant results.

## How to Use the Prompts

1. **Start with the Master Prompt**: Begin by reviewing `00_master_prompt.md` to understand the overall architecture and implementation strategy.

2. **Follow the Sequence**: Work through the prompts in numerical order (01 through 06) to build the system incrementally.

3. **Use with Amazon Q Developer**: Copy the content of each prompt when interacting with Amazon Q Developer in your IDE.

4. **Refine as Needed**: Adjust the prompts based on your specific requirements or challenges encountered during implementation.

## Example Workflow

Here's an example of how to use the prompts with Amazon Q Developer:

1. **Open Amazon Q Developer** in your IDE.

2. **Copy the content** of `01_core_infrastructure.md`.

3. **Paste into Amazon Q Developer** and ask it to generate the required code:
   ```
   Please implement the core infrastructure for CompliAgent-SG as described in this prompt:
   
   [Paste prompt content here]
   ```

4. **Review and refine** the generated code.

5. **Implement the code** in your project.

6. **Move to the next prompt** and repeat the process.

## Tips for Effective Use

- **Be specific** when asking Amazon Q to implement parts of the prompt.
- **Break down complex tasks** into smaller, more manageable requests.
- **Provide context** about what you've already implemented.
- **Ask for explanations** if you don't understand the generated code.
- **Request alternatives** if the initial solution doesn't meet your needs.

## Example Prompt Usage

Here's an example of how to use the document processing prompt:

```
I need to implement the MAS website scraper Lambda function as described in the document processing prompt. The function should scrape the MAS website for regulatory documents, download PDFs to S3, and trigger the Textract processing pipeline. Please generate the Python code for this Lambda function.
```

## Customizing the Prompts

Feel free to customize the prompts to better fit your specific requirements or to address challenges that arise during implementation. You can:

- Add more detailed requirements
- Specify different AWS services or configurations
- Adjust the implementation approach
- Include additional constraints or considerations

## Next Steps

After using the prompts to implement the core components of CompliAgent-SG, you can:

1. **Test the system** end-to-end
2. **Optimize performance** based on real-world usage
3. **Enhance security** with additional measures
4. **Add features** beyond the initial requirements
5. **Document the implementation** for future reference
